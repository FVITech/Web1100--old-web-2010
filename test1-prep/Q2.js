// Question 2

// Create a function called adventureSelector that takes 1 argument/parameter
// called num. adventureSelector should return 1 of 2 different anonymous
// function, based on the number that is passed into it.
//
// Each of the two anonymous functions should console.log the following messages:
//
// If the number is 1:
//
//    You selected Harry Potter World!
//
// Else:
//
//    You're staying home with Mom. Mom can be fun, can't she?
//
// Lastly, test your adventureSelector function by immediately invoking the
// function it returns when you pass it the number 1.
