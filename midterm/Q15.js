// The above array contains 5 students' names and their ages.
//
// Create a function called minors that takes in a parameter called people.
//
// Create a for loop inside of minors that iterates through the people array.
//
// Inside the for loop, if a person has an age that is less than 18, log that
// person's name (only their name, not their age) to the console.
//
// Then call minors and input the students array as the people parameter.
