var list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

// Create two variables called first and last.
//
// Using the array method that removes the first item from an array,
// remove the first value from list and assign it to the variable called first.
//
// Then use the array method that removes the last item in an array and assign
// that value to the variable called last.
//
// Finally, log first, last, and list to the console.
