// Question 16

var students = [
  {name: "clarise", age: 17},
  {name: "jose",    age: 18},
  {name: "emilia",  age: 19},
  {name: "brandon", age: 16},
  {name: "chuck",   age: 18}
];

// Same as the previous question, but this time students is an array of objects
//
// Copy your solution from the question 15 and modify it to work with this new
// students array.
//
// Also, change the name of the function from minors to adults.
// Then change the condition to if age is greater than or equal to 18 instead
// of less than 18. Don't forget to call your adults function at the end.
